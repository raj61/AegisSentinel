Demo Plan: Aegis Sentinel in Action
🎭 Step 1: Simulate a Multi-Failure Scenario
Inject a database crash (log anomaly)


Launch an adversarial attack on a fraud detection AI model


🧠 Step 2: Watch Aegis Sentinel Respond
Log Anomaly Detected:
 → Flag issue via LogBERT
 → Trace root cause using GNN
 → Restart affected service (via RL agent)


AI Failure Detected:
 → Block adversarial traffic
 → Trigger retraining / rollback of fraud model


📊 Step 3: Visual + Quantitative Insights
3D system dependency map lights up affected paths


Dashboard displays:


Time to detect & mitigate


Before/after system health


Reinforcement agent's decision sequence


Confidence score on anomaly detection






🔍 Unified Anomaly Detection
LogBERT + Autoencoders: Real-time detection of anomalies in structured and unstructured logs, as well as data drift in AI models.


GAN-based Detection: Identifies adversarial inputs and suspicious patterns in data pipelines (e.g., fraud, manipulated images).


🧠 Root-Cause Analysis Across Domains
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Model system dependencies and failure paths, mapping how low-level issues (e.g., DB latency) impact AI model performance or service SLAs.


🤖 Autonomous Remediation Loop
Reinforcement Learning Agents:


Restart failing services or scale pods (Kubernetes)


Trigger model retraining or rollback


Apply throttling, isolation, or traffic-shaping for attacks


Human-in-the-Loop Memory: Learns from manual incident responses to improve future mitigation speed and accuracy.


📊 Real-Time Visibility
3D Dependency Visualization (Three.js): Live system topology with root cause tracing.


Dashboards: Metrics, logs, drift scores, remediation timelines — all in one view.

🧪 Suggested Build Focus (Technical Weight + Hackathon Ready)
1. Graph-based RCA (Root Cause Tracer)
Why it wins: Visual, technically deep, and intuitive to explain.
Represent system as directed graph (service dependencies)


Each node has:


health score from anomaly detector


timestamps for failure detection


When anomaly occurs:


Use reverse BFS or belief propagation to trace likely source


Score edges/nodes as root-cause probability


🔧 Stack:
Graphlib / NetworkX / Cytoscape.js (graph engine)


JSON format for live updates


Optional: encode node status as vectors



2. Hybrid Anomaly Detection Engine
Why it wins: It shows you're not just hardcoding stuff.
Use:


Log regex rules for known issues (demo-ready)


Pretrained LogBERT or PCA/Autoencoder (offline-inference)


Anomaly = z-score / reconstruction loss / embedding shift


🔧 Stack:
Python + Scikit-learn for PCA baseline


Hugging Face LogBERT or simulate with bert-base-uncased


Stream logs → detect anomalies in near real-time



3. Autonomous Remediation with Policy/Rules
Why it wins: Connects detection to action.
Start with rule-based fixes:

 json
CopyEdit
{
  "db_timeout": "restart db",
  "ml_latency": "scale ml-service"
}


Wrap into a remediation engine:

 python
CopyEdit
if score > threshold and known_issue:
    run_fix(fix_map[issue])


🔧 Bonus:
Store fix effectiveness


Confidence scoring: update policies after success/fail



4. Remediation Learner (Adaptive)
Why it wins: Shows growth of system over time.
When a human fixes an issue manually:


Capture logs, graph state, metadata


Store fix signature + outcome


Next time similar issue → apply automatically


🔧 Stack:
SQLite / Redis fix memory


Simple cosine similarity between vectorized log patterns



5. Live Demo View
Why it wins: Ties it all together for judges.
React or CLI dashboard with:


Anomaly score stream


Graph updates in real-time


“FIXED” or “Escalated to Human” output


Visualizes coverage improving over time
