## Anomaly Detection Models

### 1. Time Series Anomaly Detection

Aegis Sentinel employs multiple complementary approaches for time series anomaly detection:

#### Statistical Methods

- **Z-Score Analysis**: Identifies data points that deviate significantly from the mean
- **ARIMA Models**: Captures temporal dependencies and seasonality
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Adaptive forecasting with trend and seasonality components
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Separates time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components
