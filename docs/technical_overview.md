## Technical Complexity

### 1. Graph-Based Service Modeling

Aegis Sentinel employs advanced graph theory algorithms to model complex service relationships:

```python
# Example: Service relationship inference using graph algorithms
def infer_relationships(self) -> None:
    """
    Infer relationships between services based on common patterns and naming conventions.
    This method adds edges to the graph based on service types, names, and other heuristics.
    """
    # Group related nodes (e.g., backend and backend-service)
    service_groups = self._group_related_services()
    
    # Collect primary nodes by category
    frontend_groups = []
    backend_groups = []
    database_groups = []
    
    # Apply common microservice patterns
    for frontend_name, frontend_nodes in frontend_groups:
        for backend_name, backend_nodes in backend_groups:
            frontend_primary = self._get_primary_node(frontend_nodes)
            backend_primary = self._get_primary_node(backend_nodes)
            
            if frontend_primary and backend_primary:
                self.add_edge(frontend_primary, backend_primary, 
                             type="inferred-dependency", 
                             confidence=0.8)
```

The system uses sophisticated algorithms to:
- Identify service clusters and related components
- Infer dependencies based on naming conventions and common patterns
- Calculate dependency confidence scores
- Detect circular dependencies and potential bottlenecks

### 2. Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection

Aegis Sentinel implements multiple ML-based anomaly detection techniques:

#### Time Series Anomaly Detection

```python
# Simplified example of time series anomaly detection
def detect_metric_anomalies(self, metrics_data):
    # Extract features from time series data
    features = self._extract_time_series_features(metrics_data)
    
    # Apply isolation forest algorithm
    anomaly_scores = self.isolation_forest_model.decision_function(features)
    
    # Apply LSTM-based prediction model
    predicted_values = self.lstm_model.predict(features)
    prediction_errors = np.abs(features - predicted_values)
    
    # Combine multiple detection methods
    combined_scores = self._combine_anomaly_scores(
        anomaly_scores, 
        prediction_errors,
        self.historical_patterns
    )
    
    return combined_scores > self.dynamic_threshold
```

#### Log-Based Anomaly Detection

```python
# Simplified example of log anomaly detection
def detect_log_anomalies(self, log_entries):
    # Preprocess log entries
    processed_logs = self._preprocess_logs(log_entries)
    
    # Extract embeddings using NLP model
    log_embeddings = self.nlp_model.encode(processed_logs)
    
    # Cluster log entries
    clusters = self.clustering_model.fit_predict(log_embeddings)
    
    # Identify outliers and rare patterns
    outliers = self._identify_outliers(clusters, log_embeddings)
    
    # Correlate with known error patterns
    matches = self._match_error_patterns(outliers, self.error_patterns)
    
    return matches
```

The system combines multiple detection methods:
- Statistical anomaly detection (Z-score, MAD)
- Machine learning models (Isolation Forest, LSTM)
- Deep learning for log analysis (NLP transformers)
- Correlation analysis across multiple signals

### 3. Reinforcement Learning for Remediation

Aegis Sentinel uses reinforcement learning to optimize remediation strategies:

```python
# Simplified example of reinforcement learning for remediation
class RemediationLearner:
    def select_action(self, state):
        # Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
        if random.random() < self.exploration_rate:
            return random.choice(self.possible_actions)
        
        # Use learned Q-values to select best action
        q_values = self.model.predict(state)
        return self.possible_actions[np.argmax(q_values)]
    
    def update_model(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        # Q-learning update
        current_q = self.model.predict(state)[action]
        max_next_q = np.max(self.model.predict(next_state))
        
        # Bellman equation
        new_q = current_q + self.learning_rate * (
            reward + self.discount_factor * max_next_q - current_q
        )
        
        # Update model with new Q-value
        self.model.update(state, action, new_q)
```

The reinforcement learning system:
- Models the remediation process as a Markov Decision Process
- Learns optimal actions through experience
- Balances exploration vs. exploitation
- Incorporates domain knowledge through reward shaping
