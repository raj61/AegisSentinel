# Aegis Sentinel: Detection Engine Talking Points

## Key Talking Points

### 1. Multi-Model Ensemble Approach

- **Talking Point**: "Our detection engine uses an ensemble of multiple models rather than relying on a single approach. This includes statistical methods like Z-score and MAD, machine learning models like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM, and deep learning models like LSTM Autoencoders."

- **Elaboration**: "Each model has different strengths and weaknesses. Statistical models are computationally efficient and interpretable but may miss complex patterns. ML models can detect more complex anomalies but require more tuning. Deep learning models can capture temporal dependencies but need more data. By combining them with a weighted voting system, we get the best of all approaches."

- **Technical Detail**: "The weights in our ensemble are not static—they adapt based on model performance. If a particular model consistently identifies true anomalies, its weight increases. If it generates false positives, its weight decreases."

### 2. Contextual Awareness

- **Talking Point**: "Unlike traditional monitoring systems that use fixed thresholds, our detection engine is context-aware. It understands that what's 'normal' depends on factors like time of day, deployment status, and traffic levels."

- **Elaboration**: "For example, during a deployment, we expect some metrics to spike temporarily. Instead of triggering false alarms, our system adjusts its sensitivity based on the deployment context. Similarly, we maintain different baselines for peak hours versus off-hours."

- **Technical Detail**: "We implement this using context-specific models that learn normal patterns for different contexts. When an anomaly is detected, its score is adjusted based on the current context before determining if it should trigger an alert."

### 3. Advanced Log Analysis

- **Talking Point**: "Our log analysis goes beyond simple pattern matching. We use NLP techniques to understand the semantic meaning of log messages and identify unusual patterns."

- **Elaboration**: "Traditional log analysis relies on predefined patterns or keywords. Our approach uses word embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of logs, allowing us to detect novel issues that don't match any predefined pattern."

- **Technical Detail**: "We use BERT embeddings to convert logs into vector representations, then apply clustering algorithms to identify outliers. We also analyze log sequences using LSTM models to detect unusual patterns of events."

### 4. Topology-Based Detection

- **Talking Point**: "We don't just look at individual services in isolation—we analyze the entire service topology to detect structural anomalies and unusual interaction patterns."

- **Elaboration**: "By modeling services as a graph, we can detect issues like unusual communication patterns between services, changes in the graph structure, or subgraphs that exhibit problematic behavior."

- **Technical Detail**: "We use graph neural networks to learn embeddings of the service topology and detect deviations from normal patterns. We also analyze metrics like centrality and clustering coefficient to identify critical services."

### 5. Multi-Dimensional Correlation

- **Talking Point**: "Our correlation engine connects the dots across multiple dimensions—time, space, and causality—to identify related anomalies and determine root causes."

- **Elaboration**: "When multiple anomalies occur, we determine if they're related by analyzing their temporal proximity, their location in the service graph, and potential causal relationships. This helps us group related anomalies into incidents and identify the root cause."

- **Technical Detail**: "We use Bayesian networks to model causal relationships between services and infer the most likely root causes of observed anomalies."

### 6. Predictive Capabilities

- **Talking Point**: "Beyond detecting current issues, our system can predict potential problems before they occur by forecasting metrics and identifying concerning trends."

- **Elaboration**: "By forecasting metrics like CPU, memory, and latency, we can detect when a service is likely to experience issues in the near future. This allows teams to take proactive action before users are impacted."

- **Technical Detail**: "We use a combination of Prophet for trend-based forecasting and LSTM models for capturing complex temporal patterns. These forecasts feed into our anomaly detection pipeline to identify future anomalies."
